## üí° Description

### The Application

The currency converter python programs takes in input arguements of a partivular date and two currency codes from the user, and provides the conversion rate as well as the inverse rate for the specified date. 

### Challenged faced

> Working with JSON response objects 

Some of the responses recceived in making API calls involved nested JSON objects which take a while to decode and figure out.

> Figuring out the correct URL

In cases where the URL needs to take in multiple arguments, such as calculating rate for a particular time, and incorrect URL can result in errors.

### Future Implementations

A currency converter app can be expanded further to retrieve a timeline of rates to figure out the days in which rates of a particular country was the highest or lowest. 

It can also be combined with a simple alert feature using Python to set up an automated mail or alert system to tell the user of particular currency rates of interest.
